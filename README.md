# DOE Regents Exam Estimation
## 2023 Algebra I Regents exams estimation

This project estimates the number of 2023 Algebra I Regents exams that will be administered at each school eligible for distributed scoring and predicts the total number of scorers required for 2023 for this exam.

To complete this task, I used Jupyter Notebook, Python(mainly Pandas) and data from the following sources:

- Information on schools that are open in the 2022-2023 school year from the current LCGMS report: This file contains information on schools, including their name, type, date of opening, management (DOE vs. charter), and grades served.

- Information on previous Regents exam results from 2015-2019 : This file contains information on the number of exams administered in each subject by each school for the years 2015 to 2019.
